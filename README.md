# Individual-based-community-model-Netlogo

This repository belongs to our study titled:

"Single Large AND Several Small habitat patches: A community perspective on their importance for biodiversity"

It includes the Netlogo code of a dynamic individual based home range model for a community of small mammal species (NetLogo version 6.1.0). See the publication for a detailed model description (ODD).
Additionally analysis code programmed in Python is available as Jupyter Notebook (Python 3). It runs with the published data sets, which are subsets of the initial large data sets.
